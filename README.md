# Basketball Scorecard

An interactive basketball scoreboard built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Description
This was a solo project completed as part of the Scrimba Frontend Career Path. The client required for a basketball scoreboard to be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, following a provided Figma design:

The client allowed for additional features such as a count-down timer and a “New game” button.

## Methodology
I first created all the elements and designed them following the styles (dimensions, colors, font etc.) provided in the Figma file. This was done using HTML and CSS. I leveraged on flexbox and media queries to make the website more responsive. 

I used Javascript to make the scoreboard interactive. This enables for one to: </br>
•	Start a new game </br>
•	Countdown time allocated for the game ( For the purpose of demonstration, I set the timer to 6 seconds) </br>
•	Add scores for both the Home and the Guest teams </br>
•	Declare the winner once the countdown reaches 0 </br>

## Output

The scoreboard on a large-screen device:
